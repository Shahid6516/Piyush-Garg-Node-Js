# Piyush-Garg-Node-Js
Welcome to my Node.js learning journey! 🚀  
This repository contains all the **daily projects and code snippets** I build while following [Piyush Garg's Node.js Playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLinedj3B30sDby4Al-i13hQJGQoRQDfPo&feature=shared).

## 📚 About the Course

The playlist by **Piyush Garg** is a beginner-friendly Node.js course that covers the fundamentals of Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and more through practical hands-on projects.

## 📁 Repository Structure

Each folder contains code for the specific day or topic I covered while learning. Most folders will have:

- `index.js` or the main entry file
- Supporting modules/files

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Node.js**
- **Express.js**
- **MongoDB** (in later parts)
- **Postman** for testing APIs
- **JWT AUTH
- **Socket.io
- **Nginx
- **GraphQl and many more

## 📅 Learning Plan

I will try to upload **daily** or **regularly** depending on my progress.  
Each push will reflect the concept/project I learned that day.


## 📌 Goals

- Strengthen backend development skills
- Build real-world Node.js projects
- Develop confidence in Express and MongoDB

## 🙌 Contributions

This is a personal learning project. However, feel free to **star**, **fork**, or suggest improvements!
